Domain Redirect Mapper

Domain Redirect Mapper is a Python tool that reads a list of domains or subdomains from a CSV file, sequentially loads each one in a real browser (via Playwright) to follow server and JavaScript redirects, and outputs a CSV mapping each source domain to its final destination.

It also counts how many input domains redirect to each destination and identifies whether a given destination is also part of the original input list.

üöÄ Features
	‚Ä¢	Full Redirect Tracking ‚Äî Follows both HTTP and JavaScript-based redirects using a headless Chromium browser.
	‚Ä¢	Sequential Processing ‚Äî Handles one domain at a time for predictable performance and rate limiting.
	‚Ä¢	Smart Fallbacks ‚Äî Tries HTTPS first, then falls back to HTTP automatically.
	‚Ä¢	Aggregated Destination Counts ‚Äî Shows how many of your input domains redirect to the same target domain.
	‚Ä¢	In-List Detection ‚Äî Flags if a destination is also part of the input list.
	‚Ä¢	Configurable Granularity ‚Äî Choose to group counts by registrable domain (e.g. example.co.uk) or full hostname (e.g. www.example.co.uk).

üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/domain-redirect-mapper.git
cd domain-redirect-mapper

2. Create a virtual environment

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate

3. Install dependencies

pip install playwright tldextract
playwright install chromium

üß≠ Usage

Basic command

python domain_redirect_mapper.py input.csv -o output.csv

Arguments

Argument	Description	Default
input_csv	Path to the CSV file containing domains or subdomains.	Required
-o, --output-csv	Output CSV file path.	redirect_map.csv
--timeout	Navigation timeout (ms).	15000
--js-settle	Time to wait for JS redirects (ms).	2000
--count-by	How to group destination counts ‚Äî registrable or host.	registrable
--user-agent	Custom user agent string.	Chromium default
--ignore-https-errors	Ignore SSL certificate errors.	False

Input CSV format

The input CSV can either have a header named url or domain, or just a single column of domains.

Example:

domain
example.com
sub.example.com
redirected-site.net

Or without headers:

example.com
sub.example.com
redirected-site.net

Output CSV format

source_url	destination_url	pointing_to_count	points_to_list_domain
example.com	https://target.com/	2	False
another.com	https://example.com/	1	True

üß† How It Works
	1.	The script reads each domain from your CSV file.
	2.	It uses Playwright (headless Chromium) to load each page sequentially.
	3.	The browser follows server redirects, meta-refreshes, and JavaScript redirects.
	4.	The final URL is recorded for each source domain.
	5.	It aggregates results to count how many input domains redirect to the same final destination.
	6.	The results are exported to a new CSV file.

‚öôÔ∏è Example Workflow

python domain_redirect_mapper.py domains.csv --count-by registrable --timeout 20000

Sample Output:

[1/10] Resolving example.com ...
[2/10] Resolving testdomain.net ...
...
Done. Wrote 10 rows to redirect_map.csv.
3 source(s) point to a domain in the input list (by registrable match).

redirect_map.csv:

source_url,destination_url,pointing_to_count,points_to_list_domain
example.com,https://targetsite.com/,2,False
testdomain.net,https://example.com/,1,True


‚∏ª

üß© Troubleshooting
	‚Ä¢	Playwright not installed: Run pip install playwright && playwright install chromium.
	‚Ä¢	Timeouts: Increase --timeout if slow-loading pages are being skipped.
	‚Ä¢	Certificate errors: Add --ignore-https-errors if you‚Äôre testing self-signed or staging domains.
	‚Ä¢	JavaScript redirects missed: Increase --js-settle to give the page more time.
